### My name is Oleksandra Kornilova and I'm a front developer. 
I am a Frontend Developer with 3 years of experience in building responsive landing pages and working with media buying teams.
I use technologies like React, TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, CSS (SCSS), Bootstrap, PHP, and jQuery.
I’m skilled at adapting designs for different devices, connecting forms with tracking systems (TDS), and optimizing websites for better performance.
I enjoy learning new tools, solving problems, and working on projects that help businesses grow.
I have experience working with international clients, and I’m improving my English to communicate even better with teams around the world.
