### My name is Aleksandra Kornilova and I'm a front developer. 
With 9+ years of experience in finance and leasing, I am a detail-oriented analyst with a strong analytical mindset. Now, I seek a new challenge in front-end development. Proficient in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, I am confident in creating responsive web designs. Actively learning React, I keep up-to-date with latest technologies. Additionally, I possess excellent communication and collaboration skills, and my proficiency in English allows me to work effectively with diverse clients and team members. As I transition into front-end development, I am eager to continue learning and growing, committed to putting in the effort to excel in a junior role..
